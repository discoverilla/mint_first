## mint

Mint is a Tendermint based blockchain protocol that lets anyone build social apps easily. Mint was created out of a need for efficient data storage on blockchain. It provides you with a simple boilerplate code for building social communities and gets out of your way quickly.
We have also released a front-end (client) of the blockchain which is known as [UpHack](https://uphack.co). Think of it as Hackernews on blockchain.

This is one of the experiments we have been doing at Hashnode. Although it's super early, we have released the codebase to get initial feedback from the community and improve further.

## Alpha Software

This is an alpha software and shouldn't be used in production. You should use this software to experiment and learn more about blockchain.
